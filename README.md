## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast builds
- üé® Fully styled with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- üîß TypeScript + strict linting for reliability
- üîç CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- üì¶ Tree-shakeable ES modules
- üîå Future-ready: Composable components, CSS Modules support, and more

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# With npm
npm install @ocmedialab/amp
```

Add OCML Amp react component to your web project

```js
import { OcmlAmp } from '@ocmedialab/amp';

<OcmlAmp />;
```

## üåê Browser Compatibility

The amp simulator has been tested across different browsers and platforms. For the best experience:

### Recommended

- **Chrome Desktop** (Best Performance)
    - Optimal audio processing
    - Most accurate amp simulation
    - Best visualization performance
    - Recommended for professional use

### Supported

- **Safari Desktop**
    - Good performance
    - Slight differences in audio processing
    - Minor visualization differences

### Known Differences

- Audio processing varies between browsers due to different Web Audio API implementations
- Chrome provides the most accurate and consistent sound
- Safari may have slightly different EQ and distortion characteristics
- Mobile browsers may have reduced performance

For the most authentic amp experience, we recommend using Chrome Desktop.

## Local Development

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ocmedialab/amp?color=blue)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@ocmedialab/amp)
![node](https://img.shields.io/node/v/@ocmedialab/amp)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build`

To run tests, use `npm test:react18`;
