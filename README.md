## Getting Started

Install package

```bash
npm i @ocml/amp
```

Add OCML Amp react component to your web project

```js
import { OcmlAmp } from '@ocml/amp';

<OcmlAmp />;
```

## Local Development

Project is boilerplated with [TSDX React](https://tsdx.io).

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
