# Handle line endings in a cross-platform way:
# - Automatically normalize line endings for text files
# - Windows will use CRLF when checking out files, and Unix-based systems will use LF
* text=auto

# Force specific file types to use LF line endings regardless of platform
*.sh   eol=lf    # Shell scripts (UNIX line endings)
*.json eol=lf    # JSON files should have LF line endings
*.css  eol=lf    # CSS files should have LF line endings
*.html eol=lf    # HTML files should have LF line endings
*.xml  eol=lf    # XML files should have LF line endings

# Treat certain files as binary so Git doesn't try to diff them:
*.jpg  binary
*.jpeg binary
*.png  binary
*.gif  binary
*.pdf  binary
*.zip  binary
*.mp4  binary
*.mp3  binary

# Ignore unnecessary files in exports
*.md export-ignore   # Ignore markdown files when exporting the repository
*.log export-ignore  # Ignore log files in exports
*.tsbuildinfo export-ignore  # Ignore TypeScript build info files

# Merge strategy for JSON files, use 'union' to preserve changes from both branches
*.json merge=union
