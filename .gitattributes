# Handle line endings in a cross-platform way:
# - Automatically normalize line endings for text files
# - Windows will use CRLF when checking out files, and Unix-based systems will use LF
* text=auto

# Force specific file types to use LF line endings regardless of platform
# Shell scripts (UNIX line endings)
*.sh   eol=lf
# JSON files should have LF line endings
*.json eol=lf
# CSS files should have LF line endings
*.css  eol=lf
# HTML files should have LF line endings
*.html eol=lf
# XML files should have LF line endings
*.xml  eol=lf

# Treat certain files as binary so Git doesn't try to diff them:
*.jpg  binary
*.jpeg binary
*.png  binary
*.gif  binary
*.pdf  binary
*.zip  binary
*.mp4  binary
*.mp3  binary
